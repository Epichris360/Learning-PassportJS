# Learning-PassportJS
Learning to use PassportJS, for user management. following this tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local

My reason for learning Passport at this stage is because
I have been using Turbo360.co for user management and storage among other things. It makes everything super easy, but i want to learn to set everything from the ground up.
