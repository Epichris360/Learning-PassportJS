# Learning-PassportJS
Learning to use PassportJS, for user management. following this tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local

I'm learning this know because before I was using Turbo360.co for this along with storage etc. It was amazing, but i need to 
learn to do this all manually, that being user managment, using mongo/mongoose etc.
